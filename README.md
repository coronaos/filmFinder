I created this python script to help my exgf's father find where is one exact film between his 153 hard drives. (kdding he only has 5)

You should follow the template of the docs of all the title films that are in each HD, name of the doc should be hd+"hard drive number".

You can only search one film for every execution so you'll need to run again the python app.

Tutorial:
Press 1 to find a film, then press enter.
Type the film you wanna search, the script doesn't care abt caps so dw, press enter.
The program is going to tell you in which hd is the film you've wrote.
Press any key and then enter to exit the program.

easy af, innit?

Welp is in catalan feel free to translate what it says bc Mr.L is a catalan person.

I guess he'd have liked to see this program, what a pity, he probably won't see it.

kisses to everyone.
